# 🌸 CLONING_SHOPSHY 🌸

> _“Built with curiosity, courage, and lots of late-night snacks.”_

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **CLONING_SHOPSHY**, my very first full-fledged website project, built **a year ago** with lots of love 💖 and zero fear of making mistakes. This little clone is inspired by online shopping platforms and was my first dive into real-world HTML & CSS (and a sprinkle of JavaScript magic too).

## ✨ What is this?

An attempt to **clone a shopping site** — simple, static, and heartfelt. It's got:

- 🛍️ A navigation header with icons
- 💄 Category icons like Girl, Boy, Makeup, and more
- 📸 Featured banners and deals
- 🧥 Sample product listings with coupons!
- 🧭 A sweet footer with links and information

---

## 🌼 Why does it matter?

Because **this is where it all started.**  
Every mismatched div, every alignment issue, every hardcoded deal image — it all tells a story of learning. I'm keeping the bugs, the typos, and the quirks because they’re part of the journey.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🧡 HTML5
- 🎨 CSS3
- 🧩 Font Awesome
- 🌐 Basic JavaScript (external `index.js` file)
- 😄 Lots of patience and excitement

## 💌 Final Thoughts

This project isn’t perfect — **and that’s exactly why I love it.**  
Thanks for checking it out. I hope it brings you a little smile, just like it did for me when I made it. 💫

**📝 Note:** All images and links are placeholders and just part of the learning mockup.  
Built with love in 2024. 🌷
